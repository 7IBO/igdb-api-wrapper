# igdb-kit

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 64f5d72: First release: typed IGDB client with types generated from the official schema, exact result inference from selected fields, typed filters, a rate limiter shared per client id, automatic token renewal and typed errors.
- ccfbd11: Automatic multiquery batching: concurrent queries are grouped into multiqueries sized by estimated response size, invalid or oversized blocks are isolated by splitting, identical queries in flight are deduplicated, and `batch()` runs typed queries together.

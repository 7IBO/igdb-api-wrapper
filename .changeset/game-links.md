Link data across endpoints. `byGame()` fetches the rows that point to a list of games (time to beat, characters, release dates, websites, popularity…), grouped by game id, past 500 rows and batched. `igdb.defineView()` attaches them to games under typed keys, in one multiquery for a single game. `igdb.expand()` replaces ids with entities in one batched call, and keeps small reference tables such as platforms and genres in the cache. `defineSelection()` and `ResultOf<>` name and type a reusable set of fields.

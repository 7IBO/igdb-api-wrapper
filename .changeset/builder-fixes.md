"igdb-kit": patch
---

Fixes found by sending every operator to the real API: `notAll()` now throws a `QueryError` (IGDB has no such operator; its documented `= ![...]` is a syntax error), and `sort()` only takes fields of the queried endpoint, since IGDB silently ignores a sort on a relation's field such as `cover.width`. The `search` endpoint, which searches games, characters, companies and alternative names at once, now accepts `search()`.
